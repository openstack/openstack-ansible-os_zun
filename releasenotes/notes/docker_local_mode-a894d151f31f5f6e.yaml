upgrade:
  - |
    Docker mode for zun-compute has been switched to "local" mode.
    This means, that supporting etcd cluster is no longer required
    for Zun to operate.
    If you want preserve old behavior, you will need to pin Docker and
    Containerd versions back along with adding ``zun_docker_kv_storage: etcd``
    to ``user_variables.yml``
  - |
    For deployments with Zun, underlying software versions were upgraded to:
    * Docker 20.10.24 -> 27.5.1
    * Containerd 1.6.20 -> 1.7.27
    * Kata 3.1.0 -> 3.16.0
deprecations:
  - |
    Variables ``zun_docker_kv_storage`` and ``zun_docker_kv_group`` were
    deprecated and will be removed in the next release.
